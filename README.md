# User Guide
The Robert A. Nicholson Library website is designed to give patrons quick access to library resources while also providing a plethora of connections to additional information about library services. The following guide will detail each page on the site and how information is flowed through the site.

## Home Page
The home page (library.anderson.edu/) is the first page most users will see, and often the last page they view before leaving the subdomain. With this in mind, there is ready access to WorldCat, the LibGuides, and Browzine occupying a majority of the page while links to other service and information are scattered behind the various menus located in the header at the top of the page. In the footer, at the bottom of the page, are links to other Anderson University resources and redundant links to library services.

The WorldCat search function is accessed via the search bar located in the first box in the body of the page, under the title “Search the Catalog”. There are three different modes it operates in, selectable from the dropdown box located to the left of the search bar: 
* “Books & Media”
Searches for books (e.g. traditional books, eBooks, microform, theses/dissertations/manuscripts), audio media (e.g. CDs, vinyl LPs, cassettes, digital files), video media (e.g. DVDs, blu-rays, VHS tapes, reel film, digital files), magazines & journals, musical scores, newspapers, and “archival material”.  This is the default option.
* “Articles”
Searches for articles, chapters, and encyclopedia articles/entries.
* “All Formats”
Searches all of the above. Once in WorldCat, under format, there is an all button that searches a few additional format types that aren’t included in the list however a most materials are covered by this option.
The search bar, located in the center of the section, is where users type their search/query request. While any mix of alphanumeric text and special characters are allowed, it is required that something be input for the search to function. Users are blocked from searching with “empty” search bars (the gray sample “Search by…” text is factored as blank) as that would return an error from WorldCat. Users may hit the Enter key, if the search bar is selected (highlighted by orange outline), or click the Submit button to search.
The Submit button, located to the right of the search bar, sends search queries to the WorldCat catalog. It will not function if there is no text in the search bar.
Beneath the search bar are four links: 
* “Renew My Items”
This accesses a user’s WorldCat account page, from which they can manage checked out books.
* “Search Tutorial”
Activates a pop-up which displays a video on using WorldCat and its search functions.
* “Course Reserves”
This accesses a list of courses in which users may view held materials for.
* “Advanced Search”
This accesses the Advanced Search function on WorldCat where users can apply custom and additional parameters to their searches.

The next section of the page contains three large boxes: “DATABASES”, “LIBRARY GUIDES”, and “BROWSE eJOURNALS”. Each of these boxes can be clicked to access labeled resources. The left two connect to the LibGuide subdomain (libguides.anderson.edu) but different points: “Databases” links to the full “A to Z” list of accessible databases while “Library Guides” links to course/major specific database lists. The right most box, “Browse eJournals”, directly accesses the Nicholson Library’s Browzine collection of eBooks/eJournals/eMagazines.

Below the search and database sections is the Special Events banner. It highlights any planned library events, limited time collections, or seasonal messages. This item may regularly change and is currently awaiting approval.

Located in the bottom right corner of the browser window is a button labeled “Chat with a Librarian”. When clicked a chat box will appear directly above the button. Click the button again to hide the chat box. Messages typed will NOT save between pages, there are future plans to fix this issue, however the current bypasses for the issue are that the chat box is available on every page and users can access other content in new tabs leaving the active chat open.

Located in the bottom left corner of the browser window is a button labeled with an image of the Earth and an upward facing arrow. When clicked a menu will appear above the button where users may change the language of the home page to Spanish (library.anderson.edu/es), French (library.anderson.edu/fr), or English (library.anderson.edu). The currently in-use language will not be selectable. To the left of that button is one labeled with an image of a light bulb. This button whiches the theme of the site between dark and light modes.
